  id: DSM
  description: |
    Controlling much of human space outside the Crescent, the Divine Sol Mandate, or simply
    'the Empire' to laymen, are a product of early space-era corporate classism and
    post-exploration boom-feudalism, ruled by the mysticized, allegedly all-powerful 'Kaiser' from
    the Prime system within the Imperial Core constellation, formerly known to archivists as Sol and
    Pisces, respectively. After the uprising of the NCWL, the Empire had found themselves diminished,
    but a succesful counter-attack managed to secure the starfortress Kal Suzerai
    and allowed for a return of Imperial forces to the area, altough control on the fringes of Taypan
    is still disputed, and raids or terror acts are common.
    
    Effectively the prime superpower of all of humanity, the Empire allows for a good amount of
    economic freedom for its subjects and promotes loyalty in a manner not too dissimilar to
    the megacorporations of old Earth, with aspiring members climbing up the noble ladder of
    different houses, such as House Olywir of the Domain system. Freeholders thinking that they
    can speak up against the current regime quickly find themselves screened against and
    detained, however, with tight information control preventing widespread dissent and
    often rewriting history itself to suit the needs of the Empire. Other races are permitted within Imperial
    ranks, but often subject to increased scrutiny and formal or informal discrimination

  name: "New Crescent Worker's League"
  id: NCWL
  description: |
    Stitched together from the still-warm corpses of many labor unions that were in disorganized rebellion 
    against Imperial forces in the Feudal Era before the collapse of Bluespace lanes leading in and out of the 
    Sector, the NCWL are the undisputed victors of the Crescent Revolution, holding four out of six systems 
    within the Sector and ruling from their seat of power in the Core. Holding socialist ideals at heart, the 
    NCWL aims to build a government by laborers, and for the people. Recently having launched a liberation campaign 
    against the Taypan system in the Outer Rim, the League are finally throwing their hats in the pile to make 
    their bid for the untamed frontier.

  name: "Taypan FreeStations Coalitions"
  id: TFSC
  description: |
    A conglomerate of pirate gangs, shipbreakers, and unsavory PMC groups, the Syndicate was formed shortly 
    after the initial arrival of the Empire into the Sector, disembodied station gangs and pirate reavers at 
    first, and slowly growing to be a regional superpower under the leadership of Imperial nobility and deserter
    Ser William 'Pincer' Moore. They've made Taypan their headquarters, thriving within the lawless frontier, away 
    from the overreaching grasp of the NCWL and reasonably far enough from the Empire's remnants still roaming 
    the Sector.

    Currently the holder of many patents and technologies from the now-defunct NanoTrasen Industries, SHI is the 
    unmatched and unrivaled corporate powerhouse in the Sector. Fingers in every pie, they manage logistics 
    between systems, development of new technologies, mining operations, and even dabble in the manufacturing of 
    space-capable vessels. Sharing the system with the Syndicate, they have made their headquarters in Taypan, 
    enjoying access to ore-rich asteroid veins.

  name: "The Taypani-Atyrian Pact"
  id: TAP
  description: |
    A loosely organized tribal community of nomadic starfarers, the Taypani-Atyrian Pact consists of several nomadic
    families of various racial backgrounds. Primarily made up of the spiritual Arabet, the militaristic Al'Seik, 
    the materialistic Izdari, and the scrappy Thukker families, they operate out of a converted capital freighter,
    moving from site to site to eke out a living. Most nomads carry the foul reputations of mercenaries, lowlives,
    smugglers, racketeers, and gamblers.

  name: "Saint Romaine's Militia"
  id: SRM
  description: |
    Formerly several fireteams of the Imperial Compliance Corps united under a single wing, the SRM have 
    found their new identity in the reclamation of escaped Imperial 'assets', as well as the 'conscription' 
    of new ones. Essentially a slaver's guild with a self-appointed divine edge, they operate out of the 
    Domain system under their Imperial overlords, but often stray into Taypan to capture victims for 
    the rebuilding effort.

  id: TSP
  description: |
    Appointed by themselves as a civil enforcement agency, the Taypan Sektor Polizei are a frontier sheriff agency 
    run solely on scant funding from confiscated items and donations from private and civilian entities. 
    Formed with the system's best interests at heart, underperforming equipment, underfunded staff, and 
    tendency to draw their members from within impoverished circles leave them susceptible to corruption - which
    the major powers of the system often has little manpower or resources to mitigate or mend.
